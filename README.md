# PythonForBeginners
This repo is meant for people who are new to Python and wanting to learn the basics. The exercises are created for you to replicate on your own so you can get use to typing out the Syantax and seeing the results of the lanuage. 

The best way to learn is to try it as you read. break it to see why it broke, and fix it to know exactly how it works. I hope you enjoy and learn as you go!
