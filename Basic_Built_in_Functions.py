#This exercise will go over basic built in functions in Python. 

#__________________________________________________________________#

#Ex. 1 This example will go over the Print function. 

print("Hello this function will print characters.")
    #The print function is used to print onto the screen the results of the declared function. 

#__________________________________________________________________#

#Ex. 2 This example will go over the String function.
print(str(5))
    #The str function will turn what is inside the () into a string variable. The example shows the conversion of a interger variable to a string variable. 

#___________________________________________________________________#

#Ex. 3 This example will go over the Float function
print(float(5))
    #The float variable will convert a interger into a decimal number. The example shows the conversion of 5 into the float 5.0. 

#___________________________________________________________________#

#Ex. 4 This example will go over the boolean function.

print(bool("True"))
    #The bool variable will convert a string into a boolean variable. In this example we converted the string True into the boolean variable of True. 

#___________________________________________________________________#

#Ex. 5 This example will go over the length function. 

print(len ('True'))
    #The len function will tell you how many characters are inside of what you're declaring. In this example True gave us the len value of 4 since there are four letters in the work True. 

#___________________________________________________________________#

#Ex. 6 These two examples will go over the sorted function. 

print(sorted([2,4,65,81,12,37,100]))
    #The sorted function will sort the numbers in ascending order (lowest to highest). 

print(sorted(["A", "V", "B", "d", "a", "z"]))
    #This example shows you that the sorted function works on muliple variable types including strings. For letters it will Ascend in the order of A-Z,a-z. 

print(sorted(["A", "V", "B", "d", "a", "z", "1", "3.0", "2"]))
    #This example shows you that the sorted function can combine multiple variables that are declared the same variable type. We can see that it sorts from 1-#####, 1.0-######.##, A-Z, a-z.
    #All of the variables are declared as strings due to them being wrapped in " ".
