#Explaination over what is going on above is below.
#______________________________________________________________#


#Define (def) is used to define a function. The function is named using snake_case. CamelCase is used when defining classes. This will be covered in another exercise.
#The () is called an argument. Parameters will go inside of the argument. Instead of using curly brackets to begin the function python uses a colon : 
#
#Python determines the end of a function based on the indentation after the function is called. You will use 4 spaces to determine the top of the function. 
#Once you are done with the function just start a new line with no indentation and it will recognize the function is closed. Python does not need a semicolon ";" like other programming 
#languages to close the function.
